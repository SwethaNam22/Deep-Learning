that the regime began to move chemical materials and chemical weapons to lebanon and to iraq gen salim idriss said from inside syria cnn could not independently verify idriss claim several senior israeli officials told cnn s elise labott that they have not seen movements into lebanon or iraq and that they did not believe it made sense for the syrians to be moving weapons so soon and iraq categorically denied that chemical weapons had crossed into its territory with an adviser to iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki speculating there is a political agency behind this claim we were the victims of chemical weapons under saddam s regime said the adviser ali al moussawi and we will never allow to let any country to transfer chemical materials to our lands at all still if the allegation were true it could fundamentally shift the assessments of u s intelligence officials cnn s barbara starr reports namely these officials have said that al assad would not disperse his stockpile of chemical weapons because he knows the united states would not bomb it that syrian security forces firmly control the weapons and that there exists a large secure infrastructure that has been moving these arms from rebel held areas moving these weapons into iraq lebanon or some other country outside syria might prompt u s intelligence authorities to question whether they were being transferred by a rogue element or whether it was evidence of a crack in the government s control the syrian opposition is afraid idriss told cnn s amanpour that al assad s forces will then use those weapons sometime in the future even after the international effort to collect and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal is finished the regime he said is behaving like saddam hussein idriss said he talked thursday about what s happening diplomatically with u s secretary of state john kerry who the rebel leader claimed told him that he will discuss with the russians how honest the regime is and if our friends discover that the regime is trying to play games and waste time idriss said by way of summarizing kerry s remarks the threat of the strikes is still on the table earlier on thursday idriss told npr that he had not received any weapons from our american friends despite reports that lethal aid had indeed started reaching the syrian opposition that includes a u s official who told cnn on wednesday that light and anti tank weapons as well as ammunition paid for by the united states albeit made elsewhere had begun flowing to syrian rebels over the past two weeks idriss told amanpour that he can t talk about weapons though he did stress that opposition forces were getting help we are getting now a lot of support from our american friends but i can t talk in detail about all kinds of the support he said for its part the opposition will support efforts to take control of and eventually dismantle syria s chemical weapons with idriss saying we will do our best to help them but the rebel leader questioned that things will play out as hoped i think the regime will prevent them to go to the locations and to do their job idriss said i think the regime will tell them today you can t go out of the hotels because the situation is very dangerous and tomorrow you can t go and they will delay and delay and even if idriss is proven wrong and syria s chemical weapons are wiped out as part of this process the rebel leader stressed that bigger issues remain in a civil war that the u n estimates has killed more than 100 000 people most of them by conventional weapons we have many many problems with the regime he said the chemical weapons are not the only problem that we have \",\n          \" cnn president barack obama promised accountability but he made clear wednesday he won t fire veterans affairs secretary eric shinseki yet over excessive and sometimes deadly waiting times faced by veterans seeking government health care the controversy has mushroomed since cnn first reported the problem last november in a detailed investigation examining several va hospitals hospital delays are killing war veterans after meeting with shinseki at the white house obama held a hastily arranged news conference in which he said he needed more time to review what was going on if these allegations prove to be true it is dishonorable it is disgraceful and i will not tolerate it period the president said in his first public comments in weeks on the issue however he made clear his main target for now was anyone who actually carried out improper practices at va rather than the retired army general at the top anybody found to have manipulated or falsified records at va facilities has to be held accountable obama said emotional issue the va problems touch on an emotional topic caring for america s military veterans many of whom served in war and the revelations of scheduling tricks and secret lists to hide months long waits for care prompted criticism of shinseki and the va on both sides of the aisle my attitude is for folks who have been fighting on the battlefield they should not have to fight a bureaucracy at home to get the care that they ve earned obama said asked if shinseki offered to resign he said the retired army general cares deeply about veterans and he cares deeply about the mission and i know that rick s attitude is if he doesn t think he can do a good job on this and if he thinks he s let our veterans down then i m sure that he is not going to be interested in continuing to serve his remarks did little to soothe critics with house republican leader eric cantor of virginia quickly asserting that the president is known for talking about accountability without ever holding anyone accountable rep john barrow of georgia became the first congressional democrat to publicly call for shinseki s dismissal since the controversy erupted after cnn s initial reporting barrow released a statement after obama s remarks that said while i don t think a change in leadership will immediately solve the serious problems that plague the va i do think it s time to give someone else an opportunity to lead the agency and begin the rebuilding process to ensure these issues never happen again calls for shinseki s dismissal the american legion a major veterans group that has called for shinseki s ouster labeled obama s decision to keep him in office unfortunate words are nice and even somewhat comforting but when will the va s house be cleansed of those who are soiling it and dishonoring the system said daniel dellinger the legion s national commander obama noted that the public wants a swift reckoning on the va issue but he defended the record of his administration and shinseki who has been the only veteran affairs secretary of his presidency in particular the president cited increased spending for va expanded services efforts to help veterans go to college and get jobs and reducing a backlog of benefits claims cnn reported last month that in phoenix the department used fraudulent record keeping including secret lists that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans some of whom died in the process bonuses paid in a new development shinseki has rescinded an 8 495 bonus awarded to phoenix va director sharon helman last month helman is on administrative leave in response to the allegations of misconduct under her watch secretary shinseki today exercised his authority to rescind sharon helman s fiscal year 2013 performance award immediately a va statement said on wednesday previously ms helman received the performance award due to an administrative error meanwhile the number of va facilities under investigation has expanded to 26 the agency s office of inspector general said tuesday last week the inspector general told a senate committee that 10 facilities were being investigated obama s deputy chief of staff rob nabors will head to phoenix on wednesday night to interview the va office s interim director and visit the facility nabors is aiding shinseki with a review of the allegations and obama said he expects a preliminary report from them next week in addition nabors is conducting a broader review of overall va health care administration with a deadline to report back to obama in a month the president said for six months cnn has been reporting on delays in medical appointments for veterans across the country with some dying or suffering harm while waiting for appointments and care the most disturbing and striking problems emerged in arizona last month with sources revealing to cnn details of a secret waiting list according to the sources at least 40 american veterans died in phoenix while waiting for care at the va there an internal va memo from 2010 first disclosed at a congressional hearing last week showed officials warned of inappropriate scheduling practices to cover up excessive waits for veterans four years ago problem cited in 2010 the memo by william schoenhard who was a va deputy undersecretary referred to a growing practice of gaming strategies that he said would not be tolerated however the cnn investigation shows such practices have continued one of cnn s sources dr samuel foote a retired va hospital physician said wednesday that va managers worried about being able to report they were meeting deadlines for providing care to veterans rather than getting accurate information on what was happening if the numbers provided to superiors looked good then the va looked good foote explained adding there s really no incentive for the upper management to get accurate numbers he said i think the va needs to get out of its delay and deny mode and start admitting that there really is a problem and that s generally the first step in solving a problem is admitting you have one the va has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to excessive waits by veterans for care and the va inspector general launched an independent investigation of the phoenix allegations and other va problems in addition to the internal review by shinseki and nabors at a senate hearing last week the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in phoenix but added there was no evidence that the excessive waiting caused those deaths more details obama sought to provide a more detailed description of the allegations on wednesday saying the cooked books and excessive waits applied more to veterans with chronic conditions who are among the 85 million va appointments each year instead of those needing emergency care at the same time he wondered if a 14 day deadline for the va to provide service to newly registered veterans a policy implemented under shinseki was realistic what is not yet clear to me is whether enough tools were given to make sure those goals were actually met obama said i won t know until the full report is put forward as to whether there was enough management follow up on monday white house spokesman jay carney acknowledged the white house learned of the situation at the phoenix va from cnn reports in april asked tuesday about the 2010 memo by schoenhard carney refused to answer and instead referred reporters to the va because it was an internal agency document the administration s response so far has included putting three phoenix va officials on administrative leave recently accepting the resignation of va undersecretary for health robert petzel shortly before he planned to retire this year appointing nabors to review va operations and the inspector general s independent investigation since the initial cnn report whistleblowers from other va hospitals have stepped forward to describe similar schemes by officials to hide the extended waits the chairman of the house veterans affairs committee gop rep jeff miller of florida called wednesday for obama to take executive action to get waiting veterans the help they need miller also has threatened to propose a contempt motion against the va for what he calls its failure to adequately respond to his panel s may 8 subpoena which included a request for information about the alleged destruction of the secret wait list in phoenix officials have denied any knowledge of it he called three senior va officials to a committee business meeting on thursday to discuss the matter the va said earlier this week that it was complying with the request for information obama said at his news conference that he wanted shinseki and the va to act now to provide care for veterans who have been waiting separately the house overwhelmingly approved legislation proposed by miller on wednesday that would make it easier to fire or demote senior executives at veterans affairs the bill would give the va secretary the authority to remove at any time any of the agency s senior executives based on performance currently executives get at least 30 days notice of a potential firing and the option of an appeal companion legislation has been introduced in the senate but its prospects are not clear florida problems meanwhile an audit team sent to the malcom randall va medical center in gainesville florida discovered a list of patients needing follow up appointments that was kept on paper instead of in the va s electronic computer system as a result three members of the gainesville va s supervisory staff have been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the inspector general s investigation va sunshine healthcare network spokeswoman mary kay hollingsworth said this week the secret waiting list in phoenix was part of an elaborate scheme designed by va managers there who were trying to hide that 1 400 to 1 600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor according to a recently retired top va doctor and several high level sources phoenix va officials denied any knowledge of a secret list and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times they acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans might have died cnn has tried repeatedly to interview shinseki but the requests have been denied rights group calls va scapegoat in scandal over wait times care cnn s nelli black paul courson scott bronstein deirdre walsh jim acosta virginia nicolaidis and becky brittain contributed to this report which
